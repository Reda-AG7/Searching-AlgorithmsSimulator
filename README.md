Introduction
------------

Pathfinding algorithms play a crucial role in various applications, including robotics, gaming, and network routing. This project aims to provide a clear and concise implementation of common pathfinding algorithms in C++.

Algorithms
----------

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-first search is an algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search explores all the vertices at the same level before moving on to the next level.

### Greedy Best-First Search (GBS)

Greedy Best-First Search selects the path that looks most promising at each step based on a heuristic function.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithm is a widely used algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

SFML Integration
----------------

SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) is integrated into the project for 2D rendering. This allows for visually representing the paths found by the algorithms in a graphical user interface.

Usage
-----

To use this project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have SFML installed.
3.  Build the project using your preferred C++ compiler

Dependencies
------------

-   C++ Compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
-   SFML Library
